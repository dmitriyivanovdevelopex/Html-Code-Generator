# Algorithms and Data Structures in C#

This repository is a cheat sheet on the most famous and important algorithms and data structures implemented in C#. All code snipptes got from repositories by following links.

## Sources

- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Graph Algorithms
- Clssical Algorithms
- Search Algorithms
- Sort Algorithms

## To Do

- Encapsulate route to separate entity, which takes string as parameter and converts it to path, folder, filename. Create something like new RouteEntity("Algorithm name"). It will contain folder name AlgorithmName/; Filename: algorithm_name.txt, Title: Algorithm Name
- Format readme links
- Implement heap sort in tree algorithms, it's missing
- Modify links to be Root/Algorithms/Concrete (done)
- Add link to previous page in htmls (done)
- Fix issues with generic brackets (done)

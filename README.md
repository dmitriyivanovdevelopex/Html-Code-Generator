# Algorithms and Data Structures in C#

This repository is a cheat sheet on the most famous and important algorithms and data structures implemented in C#. All code snipptes got from repositories by following links.

## Sources

- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Graph Algorithms
- Classical Algorithms
- Search Algorithms
- Sort Algorithms

## To Do

- Encapsulate route to separate entity, which takes string as parameter and converts it to path, folder, filename. Create something like new RouteEntity("Algorithm name"). It will contain folder name AlgorithmName/; Filename: algorithm_name.txt, Title: Algorithm Name
- Format readme links
- Implement heap sort in tree algorithms, it's missing
- Implement (or remove bst predecessor)
- ~~Modify links to be Root/Algorithms/Concrete~~
- ~~Add link to previous page in htmls~~
- ~~Fix issues with generic brackets~~
- Add link to repo in footer
- Fix links to be with normal whitespaced text
- Add descriptions to algorithms
- Add complexities to algorithms
- Resize code div, so it will be without scrolls
